I'm starting with an ECS-based "engine" that I made for an independent project.

For this project, I have implemented:
* Vector math, matrix multiplication and inversion
* Skeletons / rigs
* The ability to "drag" joints and have adjacent joints update accordingly
* Inverse Kinematics via FABRIK

I have not completed:
* Linear blend skinning
* A way to read / write models with rigs
* Animations
