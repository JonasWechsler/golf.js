# Inverse Kinematics with FABRIK

## Running
You can see a running model on

https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jonas/

When you run the program, it will spawn all 3 models on top of each other.
You can click and drag the vertices around, or right click on the end effectors
to fix them.

## Compiling and running
You need to have node.js with typescript installed. To compile, run

```
tsc
```

To run the Javascript, you need to run it on a server to deal with
cross-site issues. You can do this by running
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
and opening localhost:8000/golf.html in your browser.

## About this repo

This repository is derived from a continuing independent project I'm doing, so it has
many extra files unrelated to FABRIK. The relavent files are:

**run.ts** - contains all the initializations for the FABRIK demo

**skeleton.ts** - contains rigging code, similar to assignments 4 and 5

**kinematics.ts** - contains the Bone class, which has a special "move_endpoint" function that
executes the "drag" done by FABRIK, where it updates the entire kinematic chain

**tools.ts** - contains some helpful classes, like StringStream

**vector.ts** - contains all the basic vector and matrix operations

**vectormath.ts** - contains some code for collisions between vector structures

## .xrig file type

For models, I made a new file type called .xrig. The first line contains two
integers, B and V, where B is the number of bones and V is the number of vertices.
The next B lines contain 3 or 5 numbers: the parent ID of the bone, the x and y
offset of the bone, and optionally a clockwise and counterclockwise constraint on
the angle of the bone. If the bone's parent ID is -1, then it is the root, and its offset
represents the skeleton's position in world coordinates. The nth bone has ID
n-1, i.e. the first bone that's defined has id 0. Constraints are limited to [-PI, PI]

The next V lines contain 2 numbers:
the x and y position of each vertex. Vertices are assigned IDs in the same way.
The next V lines after that contain two integers, which are the IDs of the endpoints of
a side of the polygon. After that is a B x V matrix which describes the bone-vertex
weights of the model for linear blend skinning.

If V = 0, the model is just a skeleton.

## .xani file type

For animations, I mad ea new file type called .xani. The first line describes the type
of interpolation used, e.g. "Linear". The second is the format of the animation, e.g.
"InverseKinematics", "Absolute", or "Relative". The third is the number of times the
animation should loop, or -1 or "Loop" if it should go forever. The following lines
contain the keyframes of animation. If the animation is absolute or relative,
the first number is the bone ID, the second is the angle of the bone, and the third is
the time the bone reaches this angle. If the animation uses inverse kinematics, the same
is true but the second two numbers are a vector for the bone's position.

## Description of FABRIK

The basic algorithm is as follows:
1. Move end effector to target
2. Iteratively move adjacent vertices to nearest valid point
3. Repeat 1 and 2 for each end effector
4. Repeat whole algorithm until complete

Pseudocode can be found in the origional paper
(FABRIK: A fast, iterative solver for the inverse kinematics problem by Aristidou and Lasenby)
