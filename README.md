* Architecture
    * Buildings are desaturated
    * Surroundings are saturated
    * Materials are "as found"
    * Thermal symbolism
        * Cold areas -> warmth represents safety
        * Hot areas -> cold, wet represents safety
        * Rainy -> dry, etc.
        * Hot areas -> structures are open and disconnected
        * Cold areas -> structures are connected
    * Rooms with function
    * Room evolution optimizes?
        * Dimensions
    * Room decoration
        * Marble floors
        * Concrete floors
        * Wood floors
        * Quartz
    * Room types
        * Church (wood floors, wood furniture, books, symbols...)
        * Library (patterned floors? wood furniture, book piles)
        * Garden (plants)
        * School room (desks, books, boards)
        * Kitchen (fireplace + shelves?)
        * Chemistry Lab
        * Workshop (concrete floor, wood furniture)
        * Machine room (Pistons + gears + steam + engines...)
* Position optimization of AI
    * AI is state machine
        * States optimize for different properties
        * Food (player is far away)
        * Protection (player is near)
        * Offense (player is near)
        * Isolation (run away when player is near)
    * AI isolated to rooms
        * Binding of Isaac, LoZ
        * Naw
    * AI isolated to room types?
        * AI has an affinity for a type of room, but player is not locked off
        * e.g. spirit spawns in church room
        * critters 
* Gameplay Mechanics
    * Room lockdown?
    * Inventory
    * Room types should be more than aesthetic
* Horror Game elements?
    * Fear of death
    * Value of death
* Enemy types
    * 

* Consider having screens instead of scrolling
* Small tiles
